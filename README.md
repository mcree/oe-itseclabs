2. User awareness I. (web, e-mail, social media)
3. User awareness II. (public networks, malware, device security)
4. Cryptography I. (basic symmetric ciphers)
5. Cryptography II. (RSA, diffie-hellman)
6. Password management

8. Windows hardening
9. Linux hardening

# Usage

## Using vagrant

The preferred method is to use [vagrant](https://vagrantup.com) with 
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) as a provider:

    git clone https://github.com/mcree/oe-itseclabs.git
    cd oe-itseclabs
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-disksize
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest 
    vagrant up

After a successful "up" (that would take a while) a VM reboot would be 
needed to get to the graphical user interface:

    vagrant reload

## Populating a virtual machine

Tested with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS:

    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ansible/ansible && \
    sudo apt-get -y install ansible && sudo ansible-pull \
    --url=https://github.com/mcree/oe-itseclabs.git --inventory=localhost, \
    --tags=invm .build/playbook.yml

This will include GUI components. Default username and password is: hallgato / hallgato
