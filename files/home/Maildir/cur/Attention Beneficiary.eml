Google values your right to privacy! Your information is 100% secured and w=

   The Google Promotion Award Team has discovered a huge number of double c=
laims due to winners informing close friends relatives and third parties ab=
out their winning and also sharing their pin numbers. As a result of this, =
these friends try to claim the lottery on behalf of the real winners. The G=
oogle Promotion Award Team has reached a decision from its headquarters tha=
t any double claim discovered by the Lottery Board will result to the cance=
ling of that particular winning, leading to a loss for both the double clai=
mer and the real winner, as it is taken that the real winner was the inform=
er to the double claimer about the lottery. So you are hereby strongly advi=
sed once more to keep your winnings strictly confidential until you claim y=
our prize.
 
Congratulations from the Staffs & Members of the Google interactive Reward =
Board Commission.
 
Yours faithfully,
Sundar Pichai
CEO
