Warm greetings !

My name is Asvija B., and I am positioned as a Joint Director at Centre 
for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), a premier research 
institution in India.

I'm writing this email to explore collaborative research opportunities 
with your esteemed institute in the fields of Information Technology and 
Computer applications in the scientific domain.   I represent a team 
with strong expertise in the areas of Cloud Computing, High performance 
Computing, e-infrastructures, Parallel computing, System Software and 
Cybersecurity.  We are actively looking for prospective collaborations 
with you in these areas of interest.

A recent research funding call has been announced for Joint project 
proposals between the researchers in India and Hungary. ( 
https://dst.gov.in/callforproposals/call-proposals-indo-hungarian-joint-research-2019 
).

We believe that it is a great opportunity to make use of this call to 
come together and explore submitting joint research proposals which are 
of mutual interest.

Following is a brief description about our organization and the research 
areas we are actively working on:

Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) is the premier R&D 
organization of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology 
(MeitY), Government of India, for carrying out R&D in IT, Electronics 
and associated areas.  C-DAC has been the pioneer in setting and 
managing supercomputer facilities for enabling scientific research in 
various locations across the country.  C-DAC has also spearheaded the 
Garuda Grid - a national grid computing initiative, connecting over 45 
partnering HPC institutions across India.  We have a strong expertise in 
AI, Cloud computing and Virtualization technologies.  Our team is 
carrying out research in the area of Virtualization and Hypervisor 
security.  We are also involved in enabling many scientific applications 
on the next generation e-infrastructures for harnessing the massive 
amount of parallelism available in these architectures.  We are also 
working in the areas of system software, tools and frameworks for 
scientific computing - including cloud & grid middleware.

I request you to consider if we can have any joint project proposals, 
based on your research interests or ongoing projects. We will be happy 
to collaborate by contributing to the joint project.


Thanks and regards,

Asvija B.,

Joint Director,

Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC)

No.1, Old Madras Road, Byappanahalli, Bangalore,  India - 560038
